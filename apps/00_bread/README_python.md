# The Python Environment

Python is known as the programming language that's the second best at everything. It is a programming designed around the idea that code is not for computers — code is for humans.

Most modern operating systems (OS) come with Python pre-installed, but because the versions and libraries can vary wildly, we utilize *virtual environments* to separate out our python installations. You can think of these as mini python installations.

There's good news and bad news about these virtual environments. The bad news is that they can be tricky to initially set up. The good news is that once they are set up and running, they are very easy to manage.

## This is actually the trickiest part of the whole workshop — once we get through this, the real fun begins!
