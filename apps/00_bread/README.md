# The Coderâ€™s Toolbelt

Good Programmers are lazy. They let their computer do the tedious tasks so that they can focus on the fun aspects of programming. Developers love writing tools for themselves. Often times, this code becomes useful enough for developers to release their code to other developers for their use.

Having a good understanding of the various tools developers use to code is a large part of being a successful programmer.

Below I list the main parts of a developer's toolbelt and link to open-source (free) resources for each part of the toolbelt.

## The Text Editor

Code Text editors simply edit characters as is, they don't do word formatting. Unlike Word Processors they are not made for printing or publishing text.

There are many, many different text editors out there. For beginners I would recommend downloading [atom.io](https://atom.io/), which is an open-source multi-platform text editor written by the github development team.

### Setting Up Your Text Editor

Customizing your text editor will go a long way towards improving your dev experience. Things you'll want to ensure your editor is configured with are:

* **Syntax Highlighting** I recommend the [solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) pallete, but this is a matter of personal taste.
* **Font style and size** You will need to use a `fixed-width` font when developing. Serif or Sans-Serif styles have differing character widths which make it hard to read code. I recommend the [Anonymous Pro](http://www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/anonymous-pro) font style. It has been carefully crafted to differentiate special characters and is an open-source font.
* **Project management & Tabs** Keeping your code organized is very important. Like a tabbed browser, atom.io provides tab support and a file pane to explore a project folder.
* **Plugins** The ability to extend your text editor is also important. In atom.io you can install packages via the atom.io package manager.
