# Going Forward

[Autodidactics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodidacticism) learn things on their own, without formal schooling, however, if you have participated in this workshop, then you've already taken an important step in this pursuit — you've sought out the help of others.

Going forward with this project, I would recommend you use this repo to copy your own code and try creating your own fully-featured web app.

Topics you may want to check out to master this include:

* [More Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/)
* [SQLAlchemy](https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-SQLAlchemy/quickstart.html)
* [Security](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/security/)
* [Hosting your Site](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/config/#development-production)

More advanced:

* [Computer Science Courses](https://github.com/prakhar1989/awesome-courses)
* [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/) — a preferred python library for big web sites.
* [Mapnik](http://mapnik.org/)
