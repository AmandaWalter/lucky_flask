# Lucky Flask

Installation:

0. These instructions should be executed in the shell (see below for more information on how to do this).
1. Ensure python is installed on your system.
2. Clone this repo or download [this zip](https://github.com/octaflop/lucky_flask/archive/present.zip)
3. Install `pip` via `easy_install` (python 2)
4. (Optional) If you want to keep your python packages separate (a good idea…), then install [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) and `mkvirtualenv lucky_flask`.
5. While in your virtual environment, install module dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Additional Docs

* Zed Shaw’s [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex0.html) has robust instructions on getting your OS (especially windows) prepped for using python.
* The [flask documentation](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is *excellent* and contains a bunch of examples to get you started with both python and web application development.
